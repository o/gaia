#Gaia

Gaia is an open-source RESTful application for collecting and aggregating event metrics in timeseries manner. It shares same philosophy with [Simmetrica](https://github.com/o/simmetrica), but built for concurrency and scalability. Uses [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io) and [Redis](http://redis.io) under the hood.

###Prerequisites

* Java JDK 1.7
* Redis 2.6 or higher
* Maven (For building from source)

###Running

Get the latest source code from Github.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/o/gaia.git
```

For building a runnable "fat" JAR file, run package goal of maven in the root directory of project.

```
$ mvn package
```

After build process, JAR file will be created at `target` directory. You can run Gaia with the following command:

```
$ java -jar target/gaia-0.4.0.jar server config.yml
```

If you press `^C`, the application will shut down gracefully.

**You need to run `redis-server` before pushing events and querying stored data.**

###Configuration

Gaia uses Redis for storing data. If you need to configure default server and port address of Redis instance, you can set it from `config.yml` which located in the root directory.

###Talking to Gaia

After running Gaia, it exposes RESTful API over HTTP with JSON output for pushing and querying data. It can be accessible from `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

####How to push events

For pushing a new event, we need to make an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload including the default parameters.

```
POST /events
{
  "name": "<String>",
  "increment": "Optional<Long>",
  "timestamp": "Optional<Long>"
}
```

**Required parameters**

`name`, which is canonical name of your input data. You will also use this for querying event data. Event name should consist of alphanumeric characters and dash. (Ex: `view-userprofile-890`)

**Optional parameters**

`increment`, this argument is useful for overriding event count for submitting multiple events in single operation. (Defaults to 1)

`timestamp`, if you need irregular updates, this argument lets you specify when event occurs. (Defaults to current Unix timestamp)

Simply, if you want to send only one event related to current time, specifying `name` parameter is good enough. If everything went smoothly `201 Created` response with empty body is returned. If something went wrong (Ex: connection interruption with Redis instance) `500 Internal Server Error` response is returned.

Example:

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "foo"}' http://localhost:8080/events

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Tue, 11 Nov 2014 14:21:12 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0
```

If there was a validation error with JSON payload an error response with `400 Bad Request` for `increment` and `now` parameters, `422 Unprocessable Entity` for `event` parameter will be returned with error messages. If you forget to add `Content-Type: application/json` header in request `415 Unsupported Media Type` will be returned.


####How to query events

For querying events from Gaia, we simply make an HTTP GET request and specify the parameters about event name, data granularity and time range.

```
GET /events/<String>?start=<Long>&end=<Long>&resolution=<String>
```

**All parameters are mandatory**

`event`, as you guessed, we already used this value for feeding our data.

`start` and `end` parameters take Unix timestamp for specifying interval of time-series.

`resolution` is used for defining the resolution / granularity of data. Possible values are `min`, `5min`, `15min`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month` and `year`.

Example:

```
$ curl -sS -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/events/foo?start=1415697030&end=1415718630&resolution=hour'

[
    {
        "count": 31356,
        "timestamp": 1415696400
    },
    {
        "count": 28763,
        "timestamp": 1415700000
    },
    {
        "count": 38561,
        "timestamp": 1415703600
    },
    {
        "count": 44677,
        "timestamp": 1415707200
    },
    {
        "count": 54810,
        "timestamp": 1415710800
    },
    {
        "count": 52345,
        "timestamp": 1415714400
    },
    {
        "count": 49780,
        "timestamp": 1415718000
    }
]

```

###Events naming design

It's completely up to your **querying strategy**, keep it simple, short and meaningful. Don't hesitate to push multiple events for different querying requirements.

Here are some examples:

Scenario: How many times a product page displayed?

Schema: `<group>-<object>-<identifier>`

Example: `view-product-324569`

---

Scenario: How many times a product page displayed from desktop **or** mobile?

Schema: `<group>-<object>-<identifier>-<tag>`

Example: `view-product-324569-desktop`, `view-product-324569-mobile`

---

Scenario: How many times a product page displayed from desktop **and / or** mobile?

Schema: `<group>-<object>-<identifier>-<tag>`

Example: `view-product-324569-desktop`, `view-product-324569-mobile`, `view-product-324569-total`

---

Scenario: How many times a product listed in search results?

Schema: `<group>-<object>-<identifier>`

Example: `listingview-product-324569`

###Internals

Gaia keeps event data in hashes. Hashes are very [memory efficient](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12202313862/storing-hundreds-of-millions-of-simple-key-value-pairs) and [plays well with CPU](http://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization). Also event key lookups and querying data is faster.

All keys about events keeping under `gaia:` keyspace in redis. When you push a new event to Gaia, it sends following commands to Redis.

```
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:min" "1415809680" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:15min" "1415808900" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:month" "1415232000" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:5min" "1415809500" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:year" "1387584000" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:day" "1415750400" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:hour" "1415808000" "1"
"HINCRBY" "gaia:foo:week" "1415232000" "1"
```

This operation is enclosed in a pipeline for sending multiple commands in a single step. Using pipelining hugely improves performance of push operation.

Gaia supports different resolutions from minute to year and keeps all values without expiring old values. So, you can query values of last 2 years in a minute precision.

For the simplicity, Redis doesn't allow to expire keys of hashes. Manual deletion of hash keys for clearing old values is very expensive operation if you have millions of events, but it's in the road map.

Gaia does not support data source types like `GAUGE` and `COUNTER` . Naturally it does not use fixed sized databases like [RRDTool](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) or [Whisper](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/whisper.html).

###Deployment and operational tips

####Health checks

Thanks to Dropwizard, Gaia comes with built-in health check for verifying thread deadlocks and connectivity to Redis instance.

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8081/healthcheck'

{"deadlocks":{"healthy":true},"jedis-pool":{"healthy":true}}
```

If all health checks report success, a `200 OK` is returned. If any of them fails, a `500 Internal Server Error` is returned with the error messages.

####Running behind Nginx and Haproxy

Here is the example Nginx configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name metrics.domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }

    location /ping {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
        root /ping;
    }

}
```

To deny access to 8080 and 8081 (used for administrative purposes) ports run following rules:

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 8080 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 8081 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
```

If you're running several Gaia instances behind Haproxy, you can enable health checks with the configuration like this:

```
frontend http
    bind :80

    ...
    default_backend gaia_cluster

backend gaia_cluster
    option httpchk GET /ping
    http-check expect string pong

    ...
    server metrics04 metrics04.domain.com:80 check
```

####Running with supervisord

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) allows users to monitor and control a number of process on UNIX-like operating systems. Installation instructions can be found in [here](http://supervisord.org/installing.html#installing-a-distribution-package).

To run Gaia as a daemon with supervisord, add the following lines to supervisord configuration.

```
[program:gaia]
command=/usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/gaia.jar server /path/to/config.yml
```

Then run following commands:

```
supervisorctl reread
supervisorctl update
```

For checking status of Gaia daemon, run `supervisorctl status`.

```
gaia                             RUNNING    pid 10636, uptime 39 days, 6:15:15
```

###Tests

You can run tests with `mvn test`.
